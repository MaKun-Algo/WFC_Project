# WFC_Project
The Project for a Thesis about Methods to adjust the Wave Function Collapse algorithm for more complex Procedural Generations.

The program was used to implement and develop new methods to create a more realistic and useful output with procedural generations using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm.
Implemented methods add the ability to influence the chance for tiles to be generated through weights, as well as methods to make sure that all paths in the generated output are connected.
These methods were shown in the example of a generated dungeon, but the methods can be universally applied to the WFC algorithm and be used for other applications of the Algorithm. For example, in applications to design cities, the WFC algorithm could be used to complete district's trough procedural generation which need a realistic output and connected paths for roads and walkways.

To see the created C# scripts, open the Assets/Scripts folder. There are all the scripts made and needed for the Application.
The Class Make_Doungen is the most important Class, executing the logic for the Wave Function Collapse algorithm, as well as the implemented adaptations of the algorithm to have a proper connected path with the procedural generation as well as other adjustments to create more realistic and usefull outputs.

To run the program, download Unity version 2021.3.15f1 and open the project folder with this Unit version. Then open the Scenes folder, open the Scene in it, and press the play button at the top.
